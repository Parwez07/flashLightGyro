# flashLightGyro
Trying to implement the micomax flashlight on and off features by shaking the phone. 
I am using the ACCELEROMETER of the phone to detecht the shake and according to the value i am calculating the value and then allowing the light on or off...
It's looking simple app but calculation made it little challenging ðŸ˜… .. 

Almost achieve what i want . 


for any update or suggestion fell free to made the changes
